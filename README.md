# Voice Controlled 3DOF Robot Arm Simulation ü§ñüéôÔ∏è

## Overview

This project is a 3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robot arm manipulator integrated with Amazon Alexa for voice-controlled motion. The goal was to bridge theoretical knowledge in robotics, kinematics, and AI-driven control interfaces with practical hands-on experience.

## Key Features

### 3DOF Articulated Manipulator
- **Base**, **Shoulder**, **Elbow**, and **Gripper** with parallel linkage mechanism for stability and efficient movement.

### ROS2 Simulation & Visualization
- **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** for robot modeling.
- **RViz** for visualization.
- **Gazebo Ignition** for realistic physics simulation.

### Robot Links
- Base Link
- Base Plate
- Forward Drive Arm
- Horizontal Arm
- Claw Support
- Gripper Right & Left

### Camera Integration
- Mounted on the Base Link for a robot-eye perspective.

### Gazebo ROS2 Control Interface
- Utilized `gazebo_ros2_control` for managing robot movements.

### MoveIt2 for Motion Planning
- **Forward Kinematics (FK)** ‚Äì Computing end-effector position from joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** ‚Äì Finding joint angles for a given end-effector position.
- **MoveIt2 API** ‚Äì Enabling external applications to control robotic movements.

### ROS2 Communication Framework
- **Publishers & Subscribers** ‚Äì For real-time sensor-actuator interaction.
- **Actions & Services** ‚Äì For executing predefined robot tasks.

### Voice-Controlled Robot with Alexa
- Integrated Amazon Alexa Developer Console (ASK SDK) for voice commands.
- **Workflow**:
  1. User gives a voice command ‚Üí Alexa Skill processes it ‚Üí Ngrok Web Server forwards it ‚Üí ROS2 task_server executes the motion.
- Flask-based web service using **Ngrok** acts as a bridge between Alexa and ROS2, allowing seamless cloud-to-robot control.

## Final Outcome & Learnings

- Successfully controlled the robot arm with voice commands!
- Gained experience in robot kinematics, ROS2, AI voice interfaces, and real-world robotics applications.
- Explored ROS2-based control architectures, robot perception, and MoveIt2 motion planning.
